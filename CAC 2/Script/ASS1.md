Bank Marketing : Donated on 2/13/2012
Dataset Description: Bank Marketing
Description of the Chosen Dataset: Bank Marketing

The dataset I selected is called Bank Marketing, originally donated on February 13, 2012. It contains data related to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. These campaigns were carried out through phone calls, and the main goal of the analysis is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (the target variable “y”, which can be “yes” or “no”).

In these marketing campaigns, more than one contact with the same client was often necessary to determine if they would eventually subscribe to the bank’s product.

There are four versions of the dataset available:

bank-additional-full.csv – Contains all 41,188 records with 20 input variables, ordered chronologically from May 2008 to November 2010.

bank-additional.csv – A 10% random sample of the full dataset, with 4,119 observations and the same 20 input variables.

bank-full.csv – Another complete version but with 17 input variables (an older version of the dataset).

bank.csv – A 10% random sample of the “bank-full” dataset, also with 17 inputs.

The smaller datasets were created to allow researchers to test computationally demanding algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), more efficiently.

Main Objective

The main purpose of this dataset is to classify whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on socio-economic, demographic, and campaign-related variables.

Context and Purpose

This dataset was created to analyze the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns and to help banks improve their customer targeting strategies. By applying machine learning models, it is possible to identify the profiles of clients who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit, thus making marketing efforts more efficient.
